          A Communication and Collaboration Solution (CCS) is a software platform designed to
          facilitate efficient communication and collaboration among individuals or groups within an
          organization. CCS provides real-time messaging capabilities, allowing users to
          communicate with each other via text-based chat. This may include one-on-one
          messaging, group chats, and the ability to share files, images, and links within the chat
          interface. In this includes video conferencing functionality, enabling users to conduct
          face-to-face meetings and collaborate in real-time regardless of their physical location.
          Video conferencing features may include screen sharing, recording, and integration with
          calendar apps for scheduling meetings.
          With the help of this module we provides calendar and scheduling features to help users
          manage their time effectively and coordinate meetings and events.

        <h2 >Examination management</h2>
        <br>
       
        <p>
          Examination management involves the planning, organization, administration, and
          evaluation of examinations within an educational institution. A robust Examination
          Management System (EMS) is essential to streamline these processes effectively.
          The EMS facilitates the scheduling of examinations, including setting exam dates, times,
          duration, and locations. It allows administrators to create exam timetables that minimize
          conflicts and ensure efficient use of resources. The system manages student registration
          and enrollment for exams. It enables students to register for exams online, select exam
          dates and times, and receive confirmation of their registration. It also tracks exam fees,
          waivers, and eligibility criteria.
          The EMS includes a question bank where teachers can create, store, and organize exam
          questions. It supports different question types such as multiple-choice, short answer,
          essay.
